# Under Construction Directory

This directory contains the "Under Construction" page that serves as a placeholder for sections of the website that are still in development.

## Files

- **page.tsx** - The main component for the Under Construction page. It displays a message informing users that the page is under development and provides a link to return to the homepage.

## Features

- Responsive design with a clean, minimalist layout
- Custom error handling for image loading
- Navigation bar consistent with the rest of the site
- Clear call-to-action to return to the homepage

## Usage

This page is linked from various parts of the website where content is planned but not yet implemented, including:

- The new "用育康乐" (Usage, Education, Health, Entertainment) cards in the basic section of the homepage
- Other sections that are still under development

When a user clicks on a link to a section that's not yet available, they are redirected to this page instead of seeing a 404 error.
